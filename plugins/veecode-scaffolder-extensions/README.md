# VeeCode Scaffolder Extensions

## Intro üí°

The plugin **Veecode Scaffolder Extensions** is an extension of the plugin `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder`, it offers two new customized fields to be used in your backstage application:

- RepoUrlSelector
- ResourcePicker

## Pre-requisitesüìÑ

- Backstage version: "1.23.4"
- @backstage/plugin-scaffolder": "^1.18.0",
- @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-react": "^1.8.3",


## Installation üîß


If you are using yarn 3.x:

```bash
yarn workspace app add @veecode-platform/veecode-scaffolder-extensions
```

If you are using other versions:

```bash
yarn add --cwd packages/app @veecode-platform/veecode-scaffolder-extensions
```


## Getting started

### RepoUrlSelector

To configure RepoUrlSelector, we need to make a few settings first:

1-In the file `app-config.yaml` we need to add the key *scaffolder** and the information about the provider, like this:
```diff
...
+ scaffolder:
+   github:
+     - host: github.com
+       token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN_SECRET}
+   gitlab:
+    - host: gitlab.com
+      token: ${GITLAB_TOKEN_SECRET}
```

<br/>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è So far, the plugin only offers repository discovery for Github and Gitlab. For the other providers, this first step isn't necessary, as it will automatically take over the existing pattern in the `RepoUrlPicker` field.

<br/>

2- In the file `Packages > app > App.tsx` , we should make a small change:
```diff
...
+ import { ScaffolderFieldExtensions } from '@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-react';
+ import { RepoUrlSelectorExtension} from '@veecode-platform/veecode-scaffolder-extensions';

...

const routes = (
  <FlatRoutes>
   ...

-  <Route path="/create" element={<ScaffolderPage />}>
+    <Route path="/create" element={<ScaffolderPage />}>
+      <ScaffolderFieldExtensions>
+          <RepoUrlSelectorExtension/>
+      </ScaffolderFieldExtensions>
+    </Route>
  ...

  </FlatRoutes>
);

...
```

You can now use the field in your templates.

Add the field to your template file like this:

```yaml
    - title: Choose a location
      required:
        - repoUrl
      properties:
        repoUrl:
          title: Repository Location
          type: string
          description: Choose a location to create the Express Project
          ui:field: RepoUrlSelector
          ui:options:
            allowedHosts:
              - github.com
```

In the case of `github` or `gitlab`, you can omit the `allowedHosts`, the scaffolder will consult if there is the provider configured in the `app-config.yaml` and it will automatically pull in the host and the orgs belonging to it.

```diff
    - title: Choose a location
      required:
        - repoUrl
      properties:
        repoUrl:
          title: Repository Location
          type: string
          description: Choose a location to create the Express Project
          ui:field: RepoUrlSelector
          ui:options:
-            allowedHosts:
-              - github.com
```

### ResourcePicker

In the context of using the `ResourcePicker` component, the environment is used to reuse information that will be useful when creating new entities for the catalog.


We have developed customizable components to provide scaffolder with the ability to analyze environment key information of our type.


With it we can approach the reuse of this information in the creation of entities via templates.

Example of the `catalog-info.yaml` of an entity:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: "test_environment"
  environment:
    domain: your.domain
    hostedZoneId: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    vpc_id: vpc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    vpc_name: xxxxxxxxxxx
    certManagerEmail: xxx@xxx.com
    certManagerIssuerType: staging
  annotations:
    github.com/project-slug: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: development
  owner: "group:default/admin"
```

Example of using `ResourcePicker` in a template:

    - title: Enviroment Settings
      properties:
        reuseResource:
          title: Select the enviromnet from our catalog
          type: string
          ui:field: ResourcePicker
          ui:options:
            catalogFilter:
              kind: [Environment]
            

In this case, we will list in the catalog all our entities that have the type `Environment` , and behind the scenes we will scan the metadata.enviromnetchave of the chosen entity, and thus parse the information as values to serve the skeleton of our template, using the parseJSON function, also present in our core.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è We've used the custom kind `Environment` as an example, but the field can be used with any kind, as long as its `catalog-info.yaml` the selected component has a key "metadata.environment" and within it the values to be used, following the key-value order.


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è To use the function `parseJSON` in the templates in order to parse all the results coming from the filter `ResourcePicker` we need the function to be added to the plugin `Scaffolder-backend`.


example:

```yaml
...
  steps:
    - id: template
      name: Fetch Skeleton + Template
      action: fetch:template
      input:
        url: ./skeleton      
        values:
          vpc: ${{ parameters.reuseResource | parseJSON | pick('vpc_id') }}
          domain: ${{ parameters.reuseResource | parseJSON | pick('domain') }}
...
```

The use of 'pick' helps you select the property you want to use, from the return of the parseJSON function, remember to validate that the selected entity has this property, otherwise the values will be empty.
