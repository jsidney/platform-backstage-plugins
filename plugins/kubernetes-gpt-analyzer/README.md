# Kubernetes GPT Analyzer ‚ú®

The Kubernetes GPT Analyzer plug-in offers an AI approach to your Kubernetes component.

The plug-in offers a dynamic approach, in conjunction with the `@backstage/plugin-kubernetes` and `k8s-operator`:

- Application error analysis.
- Listing of errors and their respective solutions, as well as AI suggestions for resolving them.
- Analysis checking, using a timer that can be configured.

### Getting Started:



Before installing the plugin, there are some prerequisites to ensure its functionality:

- Configure the kubernetes plugin and its dependencies , :heavy_check_mark: [How to configure the kubernetes plugin :page_with_curl:](https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/) .
- Have an OpenIA Api Token, :heavy_check_mark: [Here's how to get an Open IA API KEY :page_with_curl:](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) .
- Configuring k8s-operator, :heavy_check_mark: [How to configure k8s-operator with OpenIA :page_with_curl:](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt-operator/) .
<br>


### Installation

If you are using yarn 3.x:

```bash
yarn workspace app add @veecode-platform/backstage-plugin-kubernetes-gpt-analyzer
```

If you are using other versions:

```bash
yarn add --cwd packages/app @veecode-platform/backstage-plugin-kubernetes-gpt-analyzer
```

### Backstage Configuration

Be aware that the ClusterRole used as described at https://backstage.io/docs/features/kubernetes/configuration#role-based-access-control also needs these permissions to read the k8sgpt results:

```yaml
- apiGroups:
  - core.k8sgpt.ai
  resources:
  - results
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
```

### UI üé®

In the user interface, we have two approaches: the `KubernetesGptAnalyzerCard`, which has a more minimalist look, only showing the number of errors if the AI finds them in its analysis, and a button that leads to the `KubernetesGptAnalyzerPage` component, which is the main component, where, in addition to notifying the number of errors found (if any), it also addresses the errors found and the possibility of analyzing the errors individually, resulting in an analysis with possible solutions.
Let's take them one at a time, starting with `KubernetesGptAnalyzerCard`:


#### Kubernetes Gpt Analyzer Card

As previously mentioned, the card component is only intended to notify you of errors and has a button that takes you to the main component.
To add this card to your **EntityPage**:

```diff
// packages > app > src > components > catalog > EntityPage.tsx

... other imports
+  import {
+   isKubernetesAvailable,  // if you've already imported isKubernetesAvailable from the @backstage/plugin-kubernetes plugin, you don't need to import it again
+   KubernetesGptAnalyzerCard
+  } from '@veecode-platform/backstage-plugin-kubernetes-gpt-analyzer'; 

...

const overviewContent = (
...
+           <Grid item md={7} sm={12}>
+             <KubernetesGptAnalyzerCard />
+            </Grid>
)

```

<br>


#### Kubernetes Gpt Analyzer Page

The main component of the plugin, it shows the number of errors (if any) and the cards with the errors and their respective analyses.
To configure:

```diff
// packages > app > src > components > catalog > EntityPage.tsx

... other imports
+  import {
+   isKubernetesAvailable,  // if you've already imported isKubernetesAvailable from the @backstage/plugin-kubernetes plugin, you don't need to import it again
+   KubernetesGptAnalyzerPage
+  } from '@veecode-platform/backstage-plugin-kubernetes-gpt-analyzer'; 

// On the entity page you want to add
...
+     <EntityLayout.Route if={isKubernetesAvailable} path="/kubernetes-gpt-analyzer" title="Kubernetes GPT">
+      <KubernetesGptAnalyzerPage />
+    </EntityLayout.Route>
...

```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Don't change the component's route path to a custom one, it should always be `path="/kubernetes-gpt-analyzer"`.

### Request interval ‚è±Ô∏è

By default, we have determined that analysis requests will have intervals of `1000000 milliseconds`, or 16.67 minutes. However, if you need an analysis with shorter or longer intervals, either on the Kubernetes Gpt Analyzer card or on the **Kubernetes Gpt Analyzer page**, just pass the **intervalMs** props which expects a number type data:

See:

```diff
// Kubernetes Gpt Analyzer Page

   <EntityLayout.Route if={isKubernetesAvailable} path="/kubernetes-gpt-analyzer" title="Kubernetes GPT">
-   <KubernetesGptAnalyzerPage />
+   <KubernetesGptAnalyzerPage intervalsMs={15000} />
   </EntityLayout.Route>

// Kubernetes Gpt Analyzer Card

   <Grid item md={7} sm={12}>
-     <KubernetesGptAnalyzerCard />
+    <KubernetesGptAnalyzerCard intervalsMs={15000} />
   </Grid>
...
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Remember that a shorter interval time can increase the consumption of your OPENAI API KEY.
