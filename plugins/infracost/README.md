# Infracost Plugin

<br>

## Intro üí°

The **Infracost** plugin provides a graphic representation of the application's cost estimate in its respective provider. <br>
The Plugin offers a generalized approach with all the resources used and also presents a more detailed approach with the cost components that each resource has.<br>

### Getting Started:



Before installing the plugin, there are some prerequisites to ensure its functionality:

- Have a locally installed Backstage project, :heavy_check_mark: [How to create a Backstage app :page_with_curl:](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/create-an-app) .
- Have the `Infracost-backend`  plugin installed on your Backstage, see how to install [here](https://github.com/veecode-platform/platform-backstage-plugins/blob/master/plugins/infracost-backend/README.md).
- The project's infrastructure must be provided via terraform.
- Have an Infracost API KEY. Here's how to generate one [here](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#2-get-api-key).
<br>

### Installation

If you are using yarn 3.x:

```bash
yarn workspace app add @veecode-platform/backstage-plugin-infracost
```

If you are using other versions:

```bash
yarn add --cwd packages/app @veecode-platform/backstage-plugin-infracost
```

<br>

### Configuration

Bearing in mind that the `infracost-backend` plugin is already configured and the kind `Infracost` is already available in your backstage, the next step is to generate the file **infracost-base.json** and relate it to the main project and the kind infracost.


We can generate an estimate for any component in the catalog, as long as this estimate is referenced with the same name and the same repository as the main component, and the estimate file must have the name **infracost-base.json** and be at the same level as the estimate file, which should have the kind **Infracost**.

The illustration shows a case where the component **Cluster-ec2** has in its repository a main entity of kind **Cluster** and an entity of kind **Infracost** with the `infracost-base.json` referenced at the same level.

To begin with, we need to add the annotation **`infracost/project`** to the **catalog-info.yaml** of your component:

```diff
apiVersion: veecode.backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: "cluster-ec2"
  annotations:
    github.com/project-slug: test/cluster-ec2
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
+    infracost/project: cluster-ec2
spec:
  type: ec2
  lifecycle: experimental
  owner: "group:default/admin"
```

Note in the example that the name that the annotation will receive will have the same name as the component, because it will be referencing the component to the estimate.


### Generating the contents of the infracost-base.json file:

For this step, we need to consider several possible scenarios for organizing the Infracost entity. We could implement the file within the component's own repository, create an .infracost folder and generate the entity content there, add a .content folder in the main repository with a catalog-info.yaml file of kind Location in the project root pointing to all the entities in the folder, or even create a separate repository just for the generated files. The best approach depends on the strategy adopted.


We'll cover an example of introducing estimation manually, and an example of adding a workflow to automate the process.

## Manual process

Taking into account that the project is already provisioned with terraform and the terraform apply process has already been done, just run the following command:

```bash
infracost breakdown --path plan_cache_cli.json --format json --out-file infracost-base.json
```

This command needs to be run in the project's root folder, it will generate a file called **infracost-base.json**.
Now create a folder in the project root called `.content`, move the file **infracost-base.json** to the folder and create the file **infracost.yaml**, with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: veecode.backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Infracost
metadata:
  name: "cluster-ec2"  // here it should have the same name as the main project
  annotations:
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
spec:
  type: FinOps
  lifecycle: experimental
  owner: "group:default/admin"  # your group 
  estimate:
   $text: ./infracost-base.json
```

Now the next step is to move `catalog-info.yaml`, which is in the root of the project, to the folder `.content ` folder, rename the file to reference your kind, as in the example we are dealing with a cluster we rename it to **cluster.yaml**;

**Obs**: When moving the entities to the **.content** folder, we need to change any annotations that refer to the repository's relative path, such as the **techdocs** annotation:

```diff
- backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
+ backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:..
```

In the project root, we'll create a new **catalog-info.yaml**, this time with the **Location** kind that will reference the entities in the **.content** folder:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Location
metadata:
  name: cluster-ec2-location
  description: Importing components
spec:
  targets:
    - ./.content/*.yaml
```

<br>

---

<br>

## Automated process

The organization of folders is up to you, but let's assume that this rule is adopted:

```yaml
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .content
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cluster.yaml
‚îÇ 
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ catalog-info.yaml

```

The catalog-info.yaml is a **location** that will retrieve all the other entities present in the repository as long as they are referenced in it:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Location
metadata:
  name: cluster-ec2-location
  description: Importing components
spec:
  targets:
    - ./.content/*.yaml
```
This way, when it is registered in the Backstage, the location will scan both the Cluster entity and the Infracost entity (when it is generated).

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èRemember that the Cluster is an example and can be used for any other kind.


### Generating the contents of the file `infracost-base.json`:

An important step to note is that the project needs to be provisioned by **Terraform**, it will be via **Terraform** that the provider will be defined and the necessary secrets will be generated.

Taking into account that the **infracost.yaml** files are already created within the repository of the main component, and the `catalog-info.yaml` already follows the kind model **Location**, in your project's repository, create a new workflow to run the estimate of the **Infracost** and commit the file **infracost-base.json** in your repository:

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This example is based on github, if your git provider is not github, feel free to adapt this job, note that it is very simple and open to adaptation.

`.github > workflows > infracost-estimate.yml`

```yaml
name: infracost-estimate

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "*"
      - "*/*"
      - "**"
  workflow_dispatch: 
env:
  PATH_INFRACOST: ./.content

          commit_message: "Publish infracost estimate"
          push_options: '--force'

```
<br>

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note that Infracost's **Path** is set to "./.content" because we are giving the example so that it is generated in the `.content` folder, but if the approach adopted is different, then the folder reference in the **catalog-info.yaml** of kind Location, and in the variable **INFRACOST_PATH** of the workflow.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Another important observation is that in the example we used terraform with aws as the provider, but nothing prevents other providers from being used. Just be aware of the changes to the workflow that this will entail.

<br>

### Considerations

With the entities in the repository, following the rules stated above, and with the file **infracost-base.json** generated. Simply register the location of the `catalog-info.yaml` in the Backstage, and the backend processor will save the data in the database.
Next, we'll look at the UI components to get the most out of the Infracost plugin.

<br>
---
<br>

## UI üé®

To start, we need to go to our `EntityPage.tsx` and add the tab **Infracost** to the page of the entity you prefer, in the example we'll add it to a clusterPage:

```diff
... other imports
+ import { InfracostOverviewPage, isInfracostAvailable } from '@veecode-platform/backstage-plugin-infracost';
...
const clusterPage = (
  <EntityLayout>
    <EntityLayout.Route path="/" title="Overview">
      <ClusterOverviewPage />
    </EntityLayout.Route>

  ...

+   <EntityLayout.Route if={isInfracostAvailable} path="/infracost" title="Infracost">
+      <InfracostOverviewPage/>
+   </EntityLayout.Route>
...
  </EntityLayout>
);
```
This way your component, if it has the estimate correctly configured, will have a view of the data coming from Infracost, with an estimate of the costs of the infrastructure, according to your provider:
