# Infracost Plugin

## Intro ðŸ’¡

The **Infracost** plugin provides a graphic representation of the application's cost estimate in its respective provider. <br>
The Plugin offers a generalized approach with all the resources used and also presents a more detailed approach with the cost components that each resource has.<br>
In this documentation we will cover how to correctly configure the plugin, how to create the job in your pipeline/workflow to generate the estimate and be consumed by the plugin and how to correctly reference the annotation that the UI component expects to render the content on your entityPage.

- Have a Backstage with a properly configured Postgres database, if you haven't already, see how to set it up [here](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/switching-sqlite-postgres/).
- Have the `Infracost-backend` plugin installed on your Backstage, see how to install [here].(https://github.com/veecode-platform/platform-backstage-plugins/blob/master/plugins/infracost-backend/README.md).
